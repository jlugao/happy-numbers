python exercises
================

These are just simple (or supposed to be) programming drills that I am doing to practice
the goal is to do them using TDD (and get better at it), preferably I'll use just python

It is important to notice that I am using the following technique:
- Make it work
- Make it right
- Make it better

That being said, algorithms in early stages can look ugly (and should) and sometimes can
be commited to this repo.

I am making this publicly available because:
- It makes it easier to get code reviews from more experienced developers
- It might inspire less experienced developers to do the same drills
- Well, why not?

Feel free to leave reviews and ask questions (you can use issues for that)
